[~~Turns out light mode is better for the eyes
ðŸ¤¯~~](https://www.allaboutvision.com/digital-eye-strain/is-dark-mode-better-for-eyes/)

Turns out I don't care that much, my eyes were never hurting using dark mode
and Tokyo Night Moon more well adjusted.

Window manager: [Sway](https://github.com/swaywm/sway)  
Terminal: [WezTerm](https://github.com/wez/wezterm)  
Shell: [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) + [Oh My Zsh!](https://ohmyz.sh/)  
Editor: [NeoVim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim)  
Terminal multiplexer: [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)

## Setup

[Sway](https://github.com/swaywm/sway) is a tilling Wayland compositor that can
be easily managed using only keyboard. Using it instead of desktop environment
has an advantage of not having mental overload of using `ALT+TAB` and mouse.

[WezTerm](https://github.com/wez/wezterm) is a GPU-accelerated terminal that
has great documentation and is configurable using Lua.

[Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) shell used with [Oh My Zsh!](https://ohmyz.sh/)
framework is easier to use and configure than
[bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) and in contrary to
[fish](https://fishshell.com/) is highly POSIX complaint.

[NeoVim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) is a fast and highly extensible
editor built on top of Vim.

[tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) is a terminal multiplexer of choice.
Allows saving sessions, splitting panes, easier navigation between projects and
more. A lot of mentioned features are implemented by
[WezTerm](https://github.com/wez/wezterm), but I've grown used to
[tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) and don't feel the need to change.
